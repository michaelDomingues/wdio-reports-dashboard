# Automation Reporter  

Automation reporter proposes a central way to display end to end results from automation frameworks.
It uses the core reports to produce an unique one with several *KPIs* that are shown in the dashboard.

For the dashboard itself it's used the Gentella template (developed by [Colorlib](https://colorlib.com/ "Colorlib - Make Your First Blog")), customized for the goals of the *Automation Reporter* project. This template uses the default Bootstrap 3 styles along with a variety of powerful jQuery plugins and tools to create a powerful framework for creating admin panels or back-end dashboards.

Theme uses several libraries for charts, calendar, form validation, wizard style interface, off-canvas navigation menu, text forms, date range, upload area, form autocomplete, range slider, progress bars, notifications and much more.


## Gentella

The source code is available at **[Github](https://github.com/puikinsh/gentelella)**.

## Automation frameworks reports support

Right now this is the list of framework reports supported:

* [Webdriver.io](http://webdriver.io) 

More to be added in the future.

## Requirements

In order to use this project and integrate the report data into the dashboard, it's important to:

* Generate the automation frameworks reports to **JSON** output.
* Place those into `report-results`.


The aggregated report is pushed into the `final-report` directory, which the dashboard will read from.


## Installation

Before running the installation setup in the **Makefile** is necessary to have installed `bower`, `npm` and `gulp` globally.

After you have done that just run: `make install`.

## Data report update

The resulting report from the aggregation is parsed by the server side and cached in the session storage, upon the first read.
This means that on a new session it will load the data again on the first visit. 

In case of the report file is replaced with a new one it's enough to open a new browser session to load the updated information.

## How to contribute
To contribute, please ensure that you have stable [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.com) installed.

Test if Gulp CLI is installed by running `gulp --version`.  If the command isn't found, run `npm install -g gulp`.  For more information about installing Gulp, see the Gulp's [Getting Started](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md).

If `gulp` is installed, follow the steps below.

1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. Run `make`, this will install all dependencies and open the dashboard on your default browser
3. Now changes can be made to the project!
4. Submit a pull request
