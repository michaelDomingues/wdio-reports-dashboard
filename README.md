# Introduction
`wdio parser` aggregates information from JSON reports of WebDriver.io into an exportable data object that can be read into a dashboard.

## Purpose

There are several dashboards some minimalistm, and others that don't fit the ideal look&feel for seeing the results of a WDIO testing framework.
With this project we can easily integrate WDIO reports into a custom dashboard.
